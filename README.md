Dockerize the application and write the Dockerfile in an optimized way (justify your choice of base image)


## Step 1 - Application structure
Our application will look like this at the end:
    |---- docker-compose.yml
    |---- app
           |---- app.py
    |---- requirements.txt

## Step 2 - Building our Flask app
Within the flask directory, create a new folder and call it app. Inside the app directory, create an app.py file. The code for our Flask application will be in this file.

## Step 3 - Outlining key requirements
In this step, we need to create a requirements.txt file. It contains the dependencies or packages required to run our application.

## Step 4 - Creating a Dockerfile

## Step 5 - Building and testing
